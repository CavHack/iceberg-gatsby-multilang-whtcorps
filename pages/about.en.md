## what is WHTCORPS ?

Two top-notch engineers in the Bay Area, Josh Leder(Netflix) and Karl Whitford(Amazon/Microsoft) wanted a persistence layer which was portable, platform agnostic, and custom made for distributed systems and micro-services. At Netflix, Josh felt there was a need for append-only stores, without losing the benefits of SQL. Karl had an inclination to write a graph store; the two settled for a two tier system which leveraged repeatable-read, single-writer multi-reader, and MVCC. Upon meeting the two began EinsteinDB with the hopes of empowering the community with an enterprise-ready open-source distributed NewSQL. EinsteinDB works together with MilevaDB, a golang key-value store which sits atop the Knowledge graph exposed by EinsteinDB. MilevaDB communicates with Fidel, an interlocking directorate which handles query planning, execution, and serializability via protobufs and an extensible database annotation which was all custom made and groundbreaking.

After the initial beta tests, they began working without a sound or word spoken to anyone. They decided to incorporate and pursue a new vision for enterprise software that's mission critical and innovative, without sacrificing the commodity of allowing companies, big or small, to migrate to EDB and MDB,

Today, WHTCORPS is a San Francisco company which aims to bridge the gap between decision trees in streaming environments, persistence, and embedded systems. As such, WHTCORPS refuses to be pigeonholed and continues to experiment in various different fields of interests where computational prowess has stalled. No problem is big enough for WHTCORPS.
